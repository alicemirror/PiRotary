# piscope: a digital waveform viewer for the Raspberry

# Extract the archive to a directory

tar xvf piscope.tar

# In that directory

cd PISCOPE

# To utilise a pre-built executable use one of the following make commands

make hf     # hard float to run on a hard float Pi (and Pi 2)
make sf     # soft float to run on a soft float Pi
make x86_64 # to run on a 64 bit Linux PC

# To build the executable from source

sudo apt-get install gtk+-3.0 # may take a long time

make

# to install

make install

# which installs
# - the executable (piscope) to /usr/local/bin
# - the ui definition(piscope.glade) to /usr/share/piscope

# To run you need the pigpio daemon

wget abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpio.zip
unzip pigpio.zip
cd PIGPIO
make
make install

# On the Pi

sudo pigpiod # launch the pigpio daemon

# If running piscope on another machine

export PIGPIO_ADDR=host # where host is the Pi's hostname

# or

export PIGPIO_ADDR=x.x.x.x # where x.x.x.x is the Pi's IP address.

# then

piscope &
